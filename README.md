# lithium_ion_battery_degradation_models
This code is part of a thesis work. With the objective of developing a Python library to evaluate the degradation of lithium-ion batteries, therefore, the battery degradation models that were used are from the following article, called "Modeling of Lithium-Ion Battery Degradation", by the authors Bolum Xu, Alexandre Oudalov, Andreas Ulbing, GÃ¶ran Andersson and Daniel Kirschen.



contribution: The idea is to incorporate more lithium-ion battery degradation models and to improve their codes.
